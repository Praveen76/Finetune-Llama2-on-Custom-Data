# Finetune Llama2 on Custom Data

This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning the **Llama2** language model on your custom dataset. Llama2 is a powerful language model, and by fine-tuning it on your specific data, you can create a specialized model for your domain or task.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following set up:

1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6 or later).

2. **Custom Dataset**: Prepare your custom dataset. This could be text data related to your specific use case (e.g., legal documents, medical records, customer reviews, etc.).

3. **Llama2 Pretrained Model**: You'll need access to the pretrained Llama2 model. You can find it in the [NVIDIA AI Workbench example repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-llama2-finetune).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Finetune-Llama2-on-Custom-Data.git
   cd Finetune-Llama2-on-Custom-Data
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Fine-Tune Llama2**:
   - Use the provided Jupyter notebook (`Fine_tune_Llama2_on_custom_Data.ipynb`) to fine-tune Llama2 on your custom dataset.
   - Adjust hyperparameters, training settings, and evaluation metrics as needed.

4. **Evaluate and Deploy**:
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on validation data.
   - Deploy the model for inference in your applications.
